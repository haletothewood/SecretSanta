## Secret Santa

A simple challenge I set for myself to practice TDD in JavaScript post graduating from Makers Academy

### User Stories

```
As a user,
so that I can receive a gift for Secret Santa,
I want to be able to add my name to a list.

As a user,
so that I can buy someone a gift for Secret Santa,
I want to be able to be given a random recipient.

As an organizer, 
so that I can see all the participants,
I want to be able to see a list of everyone that signed up.
```
